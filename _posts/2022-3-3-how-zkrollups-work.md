The 2022-03-03 I participated on a [meetup](https://www.meetup.com/ethereumbcn/events/283674499/) organized by [@ethdevbcn](https://twitter.com/ethdevbcn).
In the talk I explained how zkRollups work minus the zk part, focusing on what problems they face and how they could be solved.

You can find the slides [here](/slides/how-zkrollup-works/index.html). If you type `s` on the keyboard you'll be able to show the speaker notes,
which more or less have written what I plan to say on the stage.
