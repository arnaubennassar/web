I'm in Dubai to attend [ETHDubai](https://www.ethdubaiconf.org/), where I will participated on a panel about Rollups together with [@protolambda](https://twitter.com/protolambda), [@SwayLang](https://twitter.com/SwayLang), [willyk.eth](https://twitter.com/ko_willy), [@realSidhuJag](https://twitter.com/realSidhuJag) and [@felipeargento](https://twitter.com/felipeargento).

I also will do a presentation about the protocol we're cooking for the zkEVM project at [Polygon Hermez](https://hermez.io/), the Proof of Efficiency or PoE.
