						GM, I'm AB backend team lead @ PH, and today Im here to talk about how ZKR work.

					<h2>Agenda</h2>
					<ol>
						<li>Why zkRollups?</li>
						<li>How do they work?</li>
						<li>Problems</li>
						<li>Solutions</li>
						<li>Implementation</li>
					</ol>

					<aside class="notes">
						We'll start with a short intro on why are rollups needed and how do they work in general.
						<br/>
						Then I'm going to give an opinionated answer on if rollups can actually solve the intended problem.
						<br/>
						Finally I'll explain how such a system can be implemented.
						<br/>
						DISCLAIMER: there are many implementation decisions that can be made, some of the stuff that I'll mention refers to how we're doing it at PH.
						Also this talk we'll treat the ZK stuff as a black box. Im not expert in ZK, and I'm sure there is people in this audience that knows way more than me about this topic

					<h2>Why zkRollups?</h2>
					<img data-src="assets/trilema.png">

					<aside class="notes">
						I guess that you all know the blockchain trilema, but anyway:
						<br/>
						The idea is that you cannot have at the same time a system that is fully secure, decentralized, and scalable.
						<br/>
						You've to compromise in one of this areas.
						<br/>
						Rollups are supposed to solve this by borrowing the security and decentralization from a L1, and bringing scalability on top.

					<h2>How do they work?</h2>
					<img data-src="assets/abstract-implementation.drawio.png">

					<aside class="notes">
						So, how they work? [explain diagram]

				</section>

					<h2>Problems</h2>
					<ol>
						<li>Security?</li>
						<li>Centralization?</li>
						<li>Scalable?</li>
					</ol>

					<aside class="notes">
						Can the trilema be really fixed by rollups? Let's analyze them one by one...

					<h3>Solutions - Security</h3>
					<h1>audit ZK and smart contracts</h1>

					<aside class="notes">
						In terms of security rollups need to add SCs that contain the ZK verifier,
						so as long as those are well audited and tested we could say that yes, we inherit 
						the security of L1... Just like any other SC, [hironic] and as you know, no SC has been ever hacked. 
					</aside>
				</section>
				<section>
					<h3>Solutions - Centralization</h3>
					<p>Enable multiple operators, <b>consensus mechanisms:</b></p>
					<ul>
						<li>Governance: DAO decides who has the right to add new blocks</li>
						<li>100% permission less: anyone can create new blocks</li>
						<li>Turn based: SC decide who can add blocks at a given time</li>
						<li>Proof of Efficiency</li>
					</ul>

					<aside class="notes">
						Centralization is a bit more complicated... it actually depends on the consensus mechanism, in other words
						from who the SC accepts the blocks. This can be done in different ways, some examples: (explain bullet points)
					</aside>
				</section>
				<section>
					<h2>Proof of Donation</h2>
					<ul>
						<li>Implementation of a "turn based" mechanism used in Hermez Network 1.0</li>
						<li>Time slots are auctioned to best bidder</li>
						<li>Auction winner can send blocks in a specific time window</li>
					</ul>

					<aside class="notes">
						PoD is the implementation we used for Hermez 1.0, it's basically an auction where participants
						bid to gain right to mine blocks for given time slots.
						We also included a deathline that when exceeded opened the slot for everyone.
					</aside>
				</section>
				<section>
					<h2>Proof of Efficiency</h2>
					<ul>
						<li>Split the sequence and the proofing in two steps</li>
						<li>Both steps are 100% permissionless (anyone, anytime)</li>
						<li>Two states: virtual vs consolidated</li>
					</ul>

					<aside class="notes">
						PoE is what we're working on for Hermez 2.0. The main idea is to split the process of making data available
						and proofing state transitions. Both steps are truly decentralized, in the sense that anyone at any point in time
						can participate in them.

					<h3>Solutions - Scalability</h3>
					<ul>
						<li>Latency / Finality: L2 >= L1</li>
						<li>Throughput / txs/s: limited by data availability</li>
						<li>max txs/s = L1 block size / L2 tx size / L1 block time</li>
					</ul>

					<aside class="notes">
						We've seen that we can actually keep the decentralization and security properties of the L1 without huge compromises
						Now the key question is can we actually provide the promised scalability?

						IMO there is two key metrics for scalability: bandwith and latency.
						In terms of latency, we still relay on L1
						However on throughput, we're basically limited to the block space: so how many bytes do we have to store the data availability...
